### Taking notes

In lesson pages, you can take notes by highlighting a short piece of text and then clicking on¬†**Save to my notes**. You can see these notes (per chapter) by clicking on the view my notes icon, next to the¬†*TRIAL/PRO*¬†icon in the top menu.\
This page will show all your notes from the current chapter. To see notes from all remaining chapters, click on the¬†*Show previous notes*¬†button.

#### Taking notes with a personal comment

Similarly to the above, you can choose¬†**Save & add a personal comment**. The comment will show up in addition to your notes. This comment is not visible to other users.

#### Exporting your notes

You can export your notes by clicking on the Printer icon and then selecting¬†*Save to PDF*¬†in the printers list.

### Flashcards

The flashcard app is on a sub-domain. You can navigate to the flashcards app by clicking on the flashcards icon in the top bar. Try reloading the page if the icon is not visible.

### Bookmarks

You can bookmark lessons & challenges by clicking on the bookmark icon.\
You will then be able to filter your bookmarks in the sidebar and come back to the important concepts that you bookmarked.

### Popular highlights

Most commonly saved notes are displayed as popular highlights which you can save with a single click.\
Code snippets can also be popular highlights. These have an icon in the top-right corner.\
You can toggle this feature from the top-right menu. However, disabling this feature will also disable the next one.

### Font ligatures

When font ligatures are enabled, the following character¬†`===`¬†will show up as 1 character instead of 3. This can be toggled from the top-right menu.

### Achievements

There are 2 types of achievements. Feature-related achievements that you unlock using various features of the course (for example taking notes) and content-related achievements. Content-related achievements are unlocked automatically when you complete certain lessons.

### Install app

This website is a Progressive Web App. You can install it for easy access using the¬†*install*¬†button from the top-right menu. The app does not have full offline support. However, you will often be able to continue reading the current lesson that you visited before getting disconnected.

### Light/dark theme

The app has a light and a dark theme. By default, we follow your Operating System preferences.\
You can override that by selecting your theme from the top-right menu.

### Review previous lesson

On challenge pages, you can review the previous lesson by clicking on the review previous lesson icon in the top menu next to the notes icon.

### App works everywhere

### Suggest improvement

### Remind me

A good night's sleep helps you persist the content that you just acquired (more on that in the FAQ below). This button shows up on desktop after your first incorrect attempt. Click on it to get an email the next day so that you jump right back into learning!

### App updates

The app is updated frequently with fixes, performance improvements, and new features. If you haven't updated the app in a long time, then there's a chance that some challenges won't work. App updates are different from curriculum updates. The curriculum is updated almost every week with minor improvements. If a major change to the curriculum is necessary, it will be announced on the GitHub discussions.\
App updates will show up as a dot in the top-right menu. You may need to reload the page first for the update to show up. It will also update in the background after you close the app.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the teaching methodology that this course follows?

The instructor (and creator of this app) has more than 5 years of experience in teaching and public speaking. Teaching is done through empathy. I try to put myself in your shoes. I also use data from research with regards to education and memory retention to help you learn more efficiently.

### Importance of sleep

This is a¬†*very important topic*¬†when it comes to learning new topics and¬†*retaining*¬†knowledge.\
Sleeping is a very important part of the learning process. You should not go through the course in one day because when you sleep, your brain helps you move the knowledge that you acquired from short-term memory into long-term memory. Moreover, the REM phase will help you augment your existing knowledge with the new one that you acquired.\
So, instead of learning for 10 hours for 5 days, we recommend sessions of approximately 2 hours (or shorter) for several days. Take breaks, whenever you feel like it.\
When you get stuck for too long, consider trying again the next day. You can use the¬†**Remind me**¬†button.

### What kind of 'company' is this?

The company is a one-person business registered in the Netherlands. The company does not have investors and generally does things differently. It's a one-person company. So, I am the developer of the platform that you're using (that also uses open-source software), I'm the writer of the chapters/challenges and the person answering support questions.

### Who is behind this company?

Hey üëã, I'm¬†[Jad Joubran](https://jadjoubran.io/). I'm an independent consultant based in the Netherlands. I have more than 12 years of experience in programming and have received awards from Google & Microsoft (Google Developer Expert & Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in web technologies). I'm passionate about education and I love cycling & cats (and cycling with my cat üòÅ).\

### Do flashcards work?

Flashcards help you persist your newly acquired knowledge. You can answer the flashcard questions anywhere!\
I personally saw a great value with flashcards when I was learning the Dutch language, which is why I have integrated flashcards into my courses.

### Why can I only add one paragraph to my notes at a time?

This increases your focus while reading and selecting what goes into your notes. This feature mimics how we take notes with a pen and paper. Adding several paragraphs at a time is a sign of a lack of focus.

### Why does the solution unlock after ~5 minutes?

This is also based on data from research with regard to acquiring new knowledge. This helps you make more mistakes that end up benefiting you before giving up.

### Why do I have to go through the chapters one by one?

That's because content builds on top of each other.\
If for some reason this does not work for you, you can skip to a chapter yourself from the bottom-right corner.

### Why do I see values in the console that are not in the sample usage?

When you run the tests, we call your functions with extra values that are not visible in the sample usage. This is to make sure that you're not hardcoding your answer.

### How important is it to take breaks?

While it's important to practice coding as much as possible on "work" days, don't underestimate the importance of taking breaks. Make sure to take short breaks every week. For example, if you're learning from Monday to Friday, make sure to take the weekend off. Also, every few months, try taking a longer break where you completely disconnect for a whole week. Once you come back, you will have a fresh new perspective. This may provide you with the breakthrough that you're looking for.
