I need help generating a logo for my new website. 
The business name is 'learnit' (all lower case). It is an online learning platform for learning programming languages and frameworks. 
The industry is, as mentioned, development. 
Target audience is people wanting to learn or enhance their development skills.
I'm not sure what my brand values are. 
I want a retro style logo. Specifically, an old school/retro robot--something more on the kawaii/cute side basically. I want the head to be a monitor, with the eyes being like this: { oo }
I want the robot to have an antenna with a flashing led on top of it. 
I want it to use retro/synthwave colors. 
In terms of the fonts, I do like monospace fonts for the development connection--I like fonts like cpmono_v07, martianmono nerd font, or profont llx nerd font mono. I'm also open to the vcr osd mono. 
I think we can do some fun glowing effects and animations with svg if you can use svg instead of webp. 
I think initially I don't want a background--just the mascot and business name.
